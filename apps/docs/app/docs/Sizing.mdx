Size in Kookie User Interface communicates purpose, hierarchy, and function. When you choose a size, you define how users scan, understand, and interact with your interface.

## Communication

Size helps users navigate and prioritize information. Large elements attract attention and establish hierarchy. Smaller elements provide support and recede appropriately. In Kookie UI, size is never arbitrary—it always serves a specific purpose.

Some components can transform meaningfully as they grow. Avatars scale from identity markers to profile centerpieces. Images evolve from thumbnails to hero elements. Cards expand from simple containers to major layout sections.

Other components maintain consistent meaning regardless of size. Buttons, toggles, and badges serve the same function whether small or large. Making these elements larger doesn't enhance their purpose—it creates visual imbalance and distracts from primary content.

## Outlier Sizing

Outlier sizing allows certain components to scale beyond standard size ranges. Most components in Kookie UI have fixed size limits to maintain visual hierarchy and prevent interface clutter. Outlier sizing is a controlled exception that enables specific components to grow when they need to serve different purposes or take on new roles.

Kookie UI uses a scale from 0 to 9. Most components use sizes 1 through 4. Outlier sizing includes size 0 and sizes 5 through 9. Components that qualify for outlier sizing can access these extended ranges when they meet specific criteria.

## Criteria

Kookie UI restricts outlier sizing to components that meet three specific criteria. These criteria ensure that scaling decisions are purposeful and beneficial.

### Prominence

A component must function as a major layout element. It should be able to exist independently as a section, column, or anchor point. Components that always appear nested within other elements don't need outlier sizing.

### Transformation

The component's meaning must change as it grows. When scaled, it should take on new roles, support new interactions, or convey different hierarchy. A large avatar becomes a banner or centerpiece, not just a larger icon. An image can transform from thumbnail to hero element.

Components that maintain the same function at any size—like buttons—don't qualify for outlier sizing.

### Stability

The component must remain visually stable and functional at every size. Growing a component cannot introduce awkward proportions, broken layouts, or compromised readability. Typography, spacing, and proportions must maintain harmony across all sizes.

If a component cannot remain elegant and functional when large, it cannot qualify as an outlier.

## Boundaries

Components with outlier sizing are always atomic. They serve as visual endpoints and never become containers for other scaled components. Their size is self-contained, and they don't transform into layout managers when they grow.

This rule prevents hidden complexity and ensures that large-scale components remain clear in purpose and simple to use.

## Semantics

Kookie UI uses semantic sizing rather than uniform measurements. Each component's size reflects its specific purpose and role. Two components might both be "small," but each uses sizing, spacing, and proportions that suit its function.

A small card uses generous border radius to establish itself as a distinct block. A small button uses tighter spacing for efficiency. Both are "small," but each is sized with intention for its specific role.

This approach creates visual harmony without forcing rigid uniformity across different component types.

## Predictability

Every sizing rule in Kookie UI builds predictable, scannable interfaces. Outlier sizing is an explicit exception, never a matter of preference or convenience. Each component's eligibility is evaluated against practical criteria—layout prominence, semantic transformation, and visual stability.

By respecting these boundaries, Kookie UI remains maintainable and extensible. Designers and engineers know exactly when components can scale and when they must maintain their standard sizes.

Users benefit from interfaces that are both expressive and clear, avoiding confusion from uncontrolled scaling.

## Guidelines

Use size to communicate purpose and establish hierarchy. Scale components only when they're meant to transform functionally, not just visually. Apply outlier sizing with intention—every size choice should serve a clear purpose and maintain interface harmony.

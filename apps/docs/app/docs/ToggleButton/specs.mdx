### Toggle State Management

ToggleButton adds toggle state management that provides visual feedback for on/off interactions.

**State Communication:**
- **Pressed state:** Visual indication that toggle is active/on
- **Unpressed state:** Visual indication that toggle is inactive/off
- **State transitions:** Smooth visual feedback when toggling between states
- **Accessibility:** Automatic ARIA attribute management for screen readers

**Toggle Implementation:**
- Built on Radix UI Toggle primitive for robust state management
- Seamless integration with Button component through asChild pattern
- Automatic `aria-pressed` attribute management based on toggle state
- Enhanced keyboard navigation support for toggle interactions

  <Callout.Icon>
    <TriangleAlertIcon />
  </Callout.Icon>
  <Callout.Text>ToggleButton automatically manages aria-pressed attributes and provides screen reader announcements for toggle states. No manual ARIA configuration is required.</Callout.Text>
